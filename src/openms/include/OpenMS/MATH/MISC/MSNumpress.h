/*
	==================== encodeInt ====================
	Some of the encodings described below use a integer compression referred to simply as 
	
	encodeInt()
 
	This encoding works on a 4 byte integer, by truncating initial zeros or ones.
	If the initial (most significant) half byte is 0x0 or 0xf, the number of such 
	halfbytes starting from the most significant is stored in a halfbyte. This initial 
	count is then followed by the rest of the ints halfbytes, in little-endian order. 
	A count halfbyte c of
	
		0 <= c <= 8 		is interpreted as an initial c 		0x0 halfbytes 
		9 <= c <= 15		is interpreted as an initial (c-8) 	0xf halfbytes

	Ex:
	int		c		rest
	0 	=> 	0x8
	-1	=>	0xf		0xf
	23	=>	0x6 	0x7	0x1
